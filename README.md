# Abstract

With the growing popularity of internet-based loans, accurately predicting defaults on these loans is crucial. P2P (peer-to-peer) online lending platforms that utilize internet technology have significantly reduced borrowers' financing costs and improved capital utilization efficiency. The main focus for the future will be making better use of data from online lending platforms, integrating third-party data, and improving the ability to predict user default behavior.

This paper examines a default prediction model for online loans based on a Deep Neural Network (DPNN). It first analyzes the issues and risks faced by P2P lending platforms, then details the principles and characteristics of the Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN) approach, and defines a credit risk rating process for online lending using BPNN. After cleaning and selecting customer data provided by lending clubs, the paper develops a BPNN-based model to evaluate default risk for online borrowers.

The paper simulates the BPNN-based default assessment model and compares it to support vector machines and regression models. The results show the BPNN model has the highest accuracy at 98.01% and the highest recall rate at 99.82%, outperforming the other two models. The BPNN model also has a significantly higher AUC value of 0.79 compared to the other models. These findings demonstrate the high practical value of the DPNN-based online loan default prediction model. Forecasting customer default risk can help P2P lenders and platforms reduce risks, improve competitiveness, and promote more stable development of the domestic P2P lending industry.
